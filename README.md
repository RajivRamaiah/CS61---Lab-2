# CS61---Lab-2
Python driver for manuscript editing application

Rajiv Ramaiah, Dami Apoeso


we assume that the values will be of appropriate type like string or in when inserting data
only max 3 secondary authors
use | as delimiter
did not implement blob on submit as stated was allowed

when we register an author, we do mailing address before email, and we allow them to submit a preliminary affiliation
this can be updated if when they submit a new paper as well.

submitted = receive for us

secondary authors must have a first and last name separated by a space

add a check to make sure that when assigning to a reviewer they have the ri code to handle the manuscript
add a check to ensure editors can only work on their own manuscripts


we do not set a timestamp when manuscript is rejected, as it wasn't included in the domain description originally.

issue requires issue year and period not just issue for editor shell
